# Brunch on Rails example application
Minimal and Simple setup to use Brunch (http://brunch.io/) with Rails asset pipeline to compile and render react on ES6 dynamically on runtime without any gems.

Check out the `app/assets/components` folder
```bash
src: Contains all react components splitted in directories (same namespace as rails views)
utils: Some utilities classes and functions to dynamically render react component
```
